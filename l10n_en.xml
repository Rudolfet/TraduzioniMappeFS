Productions can split their output across the production lines or have them work in parallel. To make this recognizable, Revamp adds a Y(split) or II(parallel) after the production name. The greenhouses, for example, produce tomatoes, lettuce and strawberries. If the tomatoes are activated alone, it produces 100% tomatoes. If the lettuce is additionally activated, it produces 50% tomatoes and 50% lettuce.
A bakery, on the other hand, can produce bread and cakes at full capacity at the same time."/>

The farm can normally store its goods in production so that they can be processed there. If the farm now has a mission with a mission goal for production, the delivered goods will first be credited to the mission, any surplus goes to the internal warehouse.

Additionally in the MP:
If another farm has bought the production, the production behaves like a normal sellpoint.
The special feature lies in the contractor status. If farm 2 has a contractor status at farm 1, the game counts it as farm 1, so delivered goods are delivered to the production warehouse and do not count for the mission.
